okay this is a text file to remind you of things for bash

you change directories with cd (parameters)
cd .. will move you up a folder
cd ~ will bring you all the way to the top
pwd to check path
mkdir rmdir
touch (filename) to create
nano (filename) to edit the file
less (filename) to view it
when in these different things (especially less) use ":q" to exit
mv to move
cp to copy
in nano you use ctrl+letters to do any commands
ctrl+o = save
ctrl+x = exit
also dont forget to use tab to autofill stuff, makes things a lot easier
this was fun
